Pretty much the entire soundtrack from Saving Private Ryan. 

The call of the Roherrim in the Return of the King. God that makes me want to ride to my death. “Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden! spear shall be shaken, shield shall be splintered, a sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises! Ride now, ride now, ride! Ride for ruin and the world's ending!” Screaming “death at the top of my lungs.” 

Or listening to “At Wit’s End,” from Pirates of the Caribbean, At World’s End in particular. 

There was also one song from the Anime, Bleach, when fighting the people in Ardor - “Soundscape to Ardor.” I would bomb hills, longboarding to that song. Not a good idea, but super exciting tbh. Felt like I was on the ride of my life.
The Phoenix by Fallout Boy. “PUT ON YOUR WAR PAINT!”

[Bury Your Dead, Fever Dream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akJXVX8PKjk&list=PLE653DA5D84DC1E83&index=3).  The intro to this song makes me want to remove the sleeves of my t-shirt.  I like the way the guitar starts palm muted, the drums kick in, the riff goes open strings and the verse is basically a breakdown.  Some army just might hesitate and look nervously at each other to see sleeveless highsteppers with an angry look on their faces.    
Who moshes into battle?  Then the chorus is a sing along ending with "at least we can say we tried", like going out fucking swinging.

Sidenote: the Riders of Rohan should have charged windmilling.
